## Piano Moving & Storage — Our Signature Service

## At Rhino Movers, we take pride in being true piano‑moving experts. Whether you have an upright, baby grand, grand, or concert grand, our team and equipment are tailored for every model:
## • Upright Pianos & Spinet
## Compact but heavy — we use low‑profile piano boards and heavy‑duty dollies to navigate tight hallways and stairs without damage.
## • Baby Grands & Medium Grands
## Delicate balance and weight distribution require specialized padding, straps, and custom cradles to protect finish and frame.
## • Full‑Size Grands & Concert Grands
## From foyer to stage, our hydraulic lifts, ramp systems, and multiple‑man lifting teams ensure the safest possible handling for these most priceless instruments.
## • Climate‑Controlled Storage
## Short- or long‑term options in our secure warehouse keep humidity, temperature, and dust at ideal levels to preserve soundboard integrity.

## Every piano move is handled by certified technicians who understand the sensitivities of soundboards, pinblocks, and legs. We coordinate with venue managers, orchestras, recital halls, and private owners — guaranteeing on‑time delivery and repositioning under any conditions.
